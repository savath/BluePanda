Deborah Pike Coaching Website Comments

HOME PAGE
  - Navbar:
      - Height too short
      - Font too small
      - Suggest having a drop down menu rather than a modal popping up since it seems necessary to have a whole modal page 
        pop up for a few selection
      - Suggest using different colors for navbar. Black doesn't look visually appealing for this site, possibly because
        the background image is already dark.

  - Header Background Image:
      - Give more space between the three line wordings

  - "See What We Do" Section:
      - Add quotation marks (" ") to the quotes and a hyphen ( - ) before the author

  - "Biography" Section:
      - is the gold border around her picture suppose to be offset?

  - Section under "Biography":
      - Add the section title for consistency since all other sections has it
      - It says "sign in..." but i don't see where to sign in.
      
ABOUT PAGE
  - Suggest shifting her face more to the left so its not too close to the vertical gold line and description

  - "What Do You Really Want?" Box:
      - Maybe have the box horizontally fill 100% of the div width, equal top/bottom margin between her picture and 
        "My Biography"
        (Ask me to clarify if confused)

  - "My Biography" Section:
      - Might look cleaner if paragraph within left and right column have equal height. 

  - "People Are Talking" Section:
      - Have height of the "Full time job change" box vertically fill to match the height of the two left boxes
      
SERVICES PAGE
  - "Proctor Gallagher Institute" Section:
  
CONTACT PAGE
  - Align "Send A" to the left to line up with "Message"
  
FOOTER SECTION
  - It's too big for me. Maybe shrink the height and add some icons to make it visually appealing.
  
OVERALL COMMENTS
  - The site color choice is too dark for my liking. Like in the Home page, the "My Programs" section background is 
    pitch black. Maybe it might look visually appealing and not boring if the colors were light brown or something on the
    lighter gray/brown. Just my opinion.
